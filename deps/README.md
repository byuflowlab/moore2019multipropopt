The license for my code does not apply to these dependent repositories.  They are simply included in their state to simplify environment recreation.  Please refer to the current base source for licensing, etc.


Copied from main readme:

The required Julia-0.6.0 packages are located in the deps folder in their state at the time of generation.  For a recreation of the environment, they would be placed in the .julia/v0.6 folder after julia-0.6.0 is installed.  SNOPT source code is NOT included.  At the time of writing, SNOPT was the only code required paid source.  Since the repositories of many of dependancies may have been massively updated, please refer to the official source for official requirements, etc.  Obviously not all of the required julia packages are included, specifically those which are widely used or are secondary or tertiary to the main ones used.  For those you would need to ensure you have installed the julia-0.6.0 compatible versions (June 11, 2018 is when most of mine were installed).
